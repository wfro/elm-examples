# Super Fun and Cool Elm Examples

Learn by doing, as they say! This is a collection of some of my favorite small programs meant as learning exercises
written in the [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) programming language.

Check out some of the other great examples on [the official site](http://elm-lang.org/examples) and [awesome-elm](https://github.com/isRuslan/awesome-elm#examples).

Running/tinkering with these examples is gloriously easy (and one of my favorite features out of the box with Elm):

1. [Install Elm](http://guide.elm-lang.org/get_started.html)

1. Clone the repo and start the `elm-reactor` process:

```
git clone git@github.com:wfro/elm-examples.git
cd elm-examples
elm-reactor
# Should now be live at http://localhost:8000
```
